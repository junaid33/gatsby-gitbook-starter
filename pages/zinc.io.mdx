# Zinc Fulfillment

To push orders to multiple marketplaces (including AliExpress, Amazon, Walmart, etc.), we will be using Zinc.io. Zinc is an order placement API and allows us to automate orders.

## Getting Started

Since Zinc is it's own service, you will have to sign-up for an account [here](https://login.zinc.io/signup). Once signed up, you will get an API key that you can enter [here](https://dashboard.openship.org/settings) under Development. Once this is entered, you will be able to search and place respective orders. 

> Please note that Zinc charges $0.01 per product search and $1 per order. Volume pricing is available through them. Openship is also working on a managed service for users directly.  

## Integration

*If you are already using Zinc, we are offering free marketplace integration so your products can be listed on the Openship Marketplace. Please [get in touch](https://openship.org) if interested.*
