# Introduction

Openship is an operations management tool for e-commerce shops. It allows you to tap into Shopify's APIs and determine how orders are routed and fulfilled.

## Use Cases

**Dropshipping**

Source inventory from our marketplace, AliExpress, or Amazon. Go one step further and hold bulk inventory in ShipBob or ShipMonk warehouses and allow order fulfillment from multiple channels. Want to push orders directly to your supplier's shop to circumvent marketplace fees? Let's build it. We have the technology.

**Customer Service**

Build micro applications to streamline and automate your customer service. Navigate to https://dashboard.openship.org/order?store={storeName}&name={orderName} to see your order page with order information. You can use this page to show relevant order information like metafields and 3rd party app information. You can build actions that will allow customer service agents to start processes like returns or inquiries.

**Developmental Environment**

Since Openship gives you direct access to your shops's GraphQL API and a Playground, you can build any customization you'd like. You can also build UI using React.js to better interact with the API. Furthermore, you can use this to build prototype Shopify apps that can be split and turned into their own application. Once you have built the UI and functionality, you can move the file created to this Next.js Shopify App Boilerplate: https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-demo-app-node-react.

**Personal Dashboard**

Customize the dashboard to your liking and pull in pertaining info from Shopify's API. Connect with third party APIs you already use like Mailchimp, Zendesk, Zero, etc or roll your own custom implementation.

**Customized Checkouts**

Shopify can be used to sell more than just physical products. Users can use the platform to handle rentals, appointments, digital products, or even recurring payments. Instead of using apps that offer these functionalities, you can roll your own.
