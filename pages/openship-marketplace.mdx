# Marketplace Fulfillment

Alongside Openship, we have a tightly integrated marketplace where users can list their products and also source products for one-time or bulk orders. The marketplace is currently in Beta and we are accepting buyers and sellers. You can apply for Beta access [here](https://dashboard.openship.org/settings) under Marketplace.

## Getting Started as a buyer

Once your Beta access is approved, you will be able to search and create orders on the marketplace. Once the item ships, tracking will automtically be uploaded to your shop. 

## Getting Started as a seller

After Beta access is approved, sellers will be able to list their products in the marketplace. Orders from the marketplace will be pushed directly to your Shopify shop or custom backend and can be fulfilled like any other order. The marketplace will have an industry low seller fee of 4% (not including credit card processing fees). Beta sellers will have this fee locked-in.

## Integration

*We are offering free marketplace integration for Shopify shops and custom backends. Please [get in touch](https://openship.org) if interested.*
