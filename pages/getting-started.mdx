# Getting Started

To get started, please make sure you have created a free account at https://dashboard.openship.org. Once you have an account, you can go to the settings tab and enter a whitelisted URL where your dashboard will be hosted or a tunnel URL when developing locally (e.g. ngrok).

## Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openshiporg/openship
```

## Expose your localhost to the Internet

1. [Download ngrok](https://ngrok.com)
2. Open terminal and navigate to where ngrok was downloaded.
3. If you’re working on OSX or Linux, start ngrok with ./ngrok http 3000. If you’re on Windows, start ngrok with ngrok http 3000.
4. A url ending in ngrok.io will be shown in your terminal.
5. Go to https://dashboard.openship.org/settings and enter this URL in the text box and click save.

## Start the application

Run the following commands to run it in your local machine:

```bash
$ cd openship
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

Go to the ngrok.io URL from before and log into Openship using your ceredentials. Now you can customize the application and the results will be hotloaded on the ngrok.io URL. Check out the Micro Apps tutorial to build your first customization.

## Deployment

Since Openship is a Next.js application, deployment is very easy with [now.sh](https://now.sh). Make sure you have an account and have either the desktop application or CLI installed. Then run:

```bash
$ now
```

Once complete, you will have a URL ending with now.sh. Enter this URL in your settings page and replace the prodFront variable in the config.js file.

## Adding Shops

Adding shops to your own instance can be done in two ways.

1. Add it directly on https://dashboard.openship.org and then you can access it on your instance
2. Make a Shopify Partner account and create an app. Add a .env file to the root folder like so:

```env
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=00000000000000000000000000000000
SHOPIFY_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

Now when you add a shop from your URL, the app you created will be installed in the shop instead of Openship.
